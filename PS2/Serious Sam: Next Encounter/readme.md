## If you wan't it on original hardware, convert PCSX2 Memory Card to folders or extract the save file contents and these are the folder names to copy onto PS2 Memory Card:

- "BESLES-52450SERIOUS" - PAL

- "BASLUS-20907SERIOUS" - NTSC

Copy the ".pnach" file to "cheats" directory in PCSX2.
For cheats, open ".pnach" file in notepad ( or any text editor ) and see the comments and if you wan't to enable or disable some codes, just change the number before ",EE" ( 0-Disable, 1-Enable ) or put "//" in front of them. Enjoy ;)
