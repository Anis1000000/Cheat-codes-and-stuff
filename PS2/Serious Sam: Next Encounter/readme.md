There are many types which Save Builder was able to export.
Unsure which to use... well, if you have emulator like PCSX2, then use:
SLES-52450 Serious Sam (86DC4BFB).psu - PAL
SLUS-20907 Serious Sam (86DC4BFB).psu - NTSC

If you wan't it on original hardware, then copy the folder inside:
BESLES-52450SERIOUS - PAL
BASLUS-20907SERIOUS - NTSC

Copy the ".pnach" file to "cheats" directory in PCSX2.
For cheats, open ".pnach" file in notepad ( or any text editor ) and see the comments and if you wan't to enable or disable some codes, just change the number before ",EE" ( 0-Disable, 1-Enable ) or put "//" in front of them. Enjoy ;)
