# Cheats for using different codenames.

## IMPORTANT ! When going for online objectives/team pars, select "Play Online" button. BEFORE PLAYING A MISSION, select "Create Mission" and based on number of agents, your codename will also change. PRESS SQUARE OR BEGIN MISSION IN ORDER TO TAKE EFFECT (IMPORTANT FOR FIRST TIME AS IF SKIPPED, GAME CRASHES) ! After that, go back and select "Join Mission".

## DISCLAIMER ! I cannot test the codes on real hardware so I cannot promise that it works without crashes/freezes.
