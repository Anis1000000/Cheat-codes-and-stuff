# Cheats for using different codenames.

## In Offline Mode, you won't have a codename and you will see on Stats screen [NULL]. Originally, when devs were making Single Player, it supposed to be like that (Jampack Demo) but it can still be enabled/fixed. Just look for a line "Fix for not being Cobra offline" and uncomment the two pnach lines below it.

## IMPORTANT ! When going for online objectives/team pars, select "Play Online" button. BEFORE PLAYING A MISSION, select "Create Mission" and based on number of agents, your codename will also change. PRESS SQUARE OR BEGIN MISSION IN ORDER TO TAKE EFFECT ! After that, go back and select "Join Mission".

## DISCLAIMER ! I cannot test the codes on real hardware so I cannot promise that it works without crashes/freezes.
